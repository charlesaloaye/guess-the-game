# guess-the-game

This JavaScript code sets up a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user needs to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 The code uses recursive function calls to allow the user to keep guessing until they guess the correct number. 
The game provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guessed number.
